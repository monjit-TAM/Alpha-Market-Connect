7–15 years (3)

15 years (4)

Specific cash-flow needs or upcoming commitments (yes/no + details) — e.g., home purchase, education, medical.

Rationale: Time horizon is a core determinant of suitable product types and risk grade.

Notes: SEBI requires a structured tool to assess investor knowledge & experience for suitability. Do not rely only on subjective labels — combine with factual answers (instruments used, years).

How comfortable are you with investment instruments that can have high short-term volatility but higher long-term returns? (1–5 Likert; score 0–4)

Which statement best describes you?

I prefer no capital loss even if returns are lower.

I accept small capital fluctuations for better returns.

I accept significant fluctuations for higher long-term growth.

I actively seek high-risk opportunities aiming for high returns.

Behavioral tests: Optionally include short behavioural vignettes or validated psychometric items to reduce misreporting.

F. Constraints, Restrictions & Preferences (suitability)

Any regulatory/investment constraints? (Yes/No — if yes, details). Examples: no-derivatives, no overseas investments, Shariah compliant, ESG preference.

Liquidity preference: need monthly/quarterly access to funds? (score)

Minimum/maximum allocation preferences per asset class (if the client sets constraints).

Income tax bracket / tax considerations.

Will the client use margin/borrowings for investing? (Yes/No — if yes, details & prior approvals).

Rationale: Advisors must consider constraints/preferences when giving advice; SEBI expects suitability assessment to include client constraints.

G. Source & Origin of Funds / Anti-Money Laundering

Source of investment funds (salary, business profit, inheritance, sale of asset, loan, gift, etc.).

Are funds free of encumbrances? (Yes/No)

Will funds originate from multiple jurisdictions? (Yes/No — if Yes, details)

Rationale: AML / KYC compliance; SEBI and other regulators require documentation of source of funds.

H. Declaration, Consent & Acknowledgements (mandatory)

I confirm the information provided is true and complete. (checkbox + digital signature).

I understand that the risk profile is based on my responses and will be used to assess suitability; I consent to the advisor using this for advice and recordkeeping. (checkbox).

I understand that actual market returns are not guaranteed and all investments are subject to market risk; I have read the risk disclosure. (checkbox).

Consent to periodic review & to be contacted for profiling updates. (checkbox).

Rationale: Written consent and client acknowledgment of the questionnaire and its consequences are required by SEBI.

Scoring & Profile Mapping (suggested, transparent)

Compute two sums: Risk Capacity Score (from financial & liquidity items) and Risk Tolerance Score (from attitude/behaviour & experience). Normalize both to 0–100.

Combine using weighted average (example: 60% capacity + 40% tolerance) → Overall Risk Score (0–100).

Suggested overall mapping:

0–24 → Conservative (capital preservation; low equity; primarily debt instruments)

25–49 → Moderately Conservative (balanced but tilted to debt)

50–69 → Moderate / Balanced (mix of equity & debt; medium volatility acceptable)

70–84 → Aggressive (high equity exposure; some complex products possible)

85–100 → Very Aggressive / Speculative (high leverage/derivatives may be suitable with explicit consent)

Advisor action rules: For each profile, list permitted product buckets and prohibited ones (e.g., Conservative: no derivatives, no high-risk structured products). Record an automated rationale whenever an advisor recommends outside the prescribed bucket (client-specific override must be written & signed).

Suitability checklist for Advisors (to decide if a Strategy / RA style fits the client)

Does the strategy’s risk/volatility profile (max drawdown, VaR, historical monthly volatility) fit within the client’s profile bucket? (Yes/No — justify).

Is the investor’s time horizon compatible with the strategy’s intended horizon (short-term trading vs long-term investing)?

Does the investor have documented experience with the instruments used by the strategy (e.g., F&O, illiquid small caps)?

Any regulatory/ethical constraints that conflict? (Yes/No — justify).

Has the client received and acknowledged a plain-language risk disclosure for this strategy? (Yes/No).

If the strategy is complex/leveraged, has the client signed a special consent and demonstrated understanding (knowledge check)? (Yes/No)

Document the outcome and keep an audit trail. SEBI requires the adviser to ensure advice is appropriate to the risk profile.

Suggested Validation & Controls (implementation)

Knowledge verification: For clients selecting high-risk products, force short knowledge check questions; require passing threshold before allowing subscription.

Automated red flags: If capacity and tolerance diverge materially (e.g., low capacity but high stated tolerance), flag for human review and require documented suitability justification.

Versioning: Save dated copies of RPQ and any subsequent changes. Require re-consent if advisor proposes advice outside the client’s profile band.

Periodic review triggers: major life event, portfolio drawdown >X%, 12 months elapsed, client request, or change in regulation.
